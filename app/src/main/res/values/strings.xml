    <string name="temperature_advices_when_title">When to take a temperature?</string>
    <string name="temperature_advices_when_content">\u0020\u0020\u0020Whenever child seem warm, fussy, has reduced appetite or lees active then usually or when there are other signs of disease (vomiting, diarrhea, cough, rash or some other sign). Estimation of fever in child by palpation is unreliable! For instance, children with high fever have cold hand, feet and forehead due to the failure (immaturity) of the center for temperature regulation. High fever can lead to dehydration (during fever fluids intake is increased 2-3 fold). Most reliable sign of dehydration are dry lips and tongue which turns to white.</string>
    <string name="temperature_advices_how_title">How to take a temperature?</string>
    <string name="temperature_advices_how_content">\u0020\u0020\u0020In children aged up to one year it is recommended to take a temperature rectally by inserting a thermometer for about 2 cm. Hold thermometer for approx. 2-3 minutes till line stops increasing (or electronic thermometer beeps). In older children thermometer is placed in the middle of axilla is dried, and put upper arm by the body. It takes 10 minutes to take a temperature. Normal temperature measured rectally is about 37,5 째C and 37,0 째C axillary. If the child is physically active (crying, feeding, running), if surrounding or clothes are to warm, rectal temperature can reach 38 째C.</string>
    <string name="temperature_advices_elevated">When and how to take down elevated body temperature?</string>
    <string name="temperature_advices_elevated_content_1">\u0020\u0020\u0020Fever is one of the natural ways of body defense against infection. So it is reasonable to start taking down temperature when it rises above 38 째C axillary or 38,5 째C rectally. More precisely, latest recommendations advise to take down fever when child show signs of prostration and change of mood (becomes cranky). So if the child is happily running around and has 39 째C it is not necessarily needed to administer antipyretic, but on a contrary, if the child with a slight fever looks cranky and tired it should be given.</string>
    <string name="temperature_advices_elevated_content_2">\u0020\u0020\u0020Fever can be reduced by drugs and cooling. Among antipyretics most appropriate and least harmful are paracetamol and ibuprofen (in a form of syrup and suppositories), having strictly in mind not to exceed recommended doses. If the child is running high fever, it should be immediately undressed and given antipyretic.</string>
    <string name="temperature_advices_elevated_content_3">\u0020\u0020\u0020To enable gradual body cooling, room temperature should be lowered and clothing reduced. It is recommended to wait for about 20 minutes after antipyretic administration with cooling with bath, sponging or shower. During this period antypyretic will block center that trigger shivering. Namely, shivering is very powerful way of increasing the body temperature, so triggered by the sensation of cold bath it can increase fever for 1-2 degrees instead of expected decrease! Most appropriate would be bath-tub filled with water of around 37 째C (or 2-3 degrees less than body temperature) and to let child ply in it for about 20 minutes and gradually cool down. Skin rubbing with alcohol is not recommended - sudden cooling of skin causes vasoconstriction and reduces cooling effect, some of the alcohol penetrates skin and some vapors are inhaled. If body temperature is not reduced, following bath, wrap the child in wet sheet or towel previously soaked in room temperature water, and change it periodically, as long as needed.</string>
    <string name="temperature_advices_elevated_content_4">\u0020\u0020\u0020During the fever child need much more liquids (daily need of liquid can be even doubled), so it is important to offer water, juice or room temperature tea. Only after those measures are undertaken, medical assistance should be asked for.</string>
    <string name="temperature_advices_important_title">It is important to have antipyretics at home before child gets ill!</string>
    <string name="temperature_advices_assistance_title">When to ask for medical assistance without delay?</string>
    <string name="temperature_advices_assistance_content">\u0020\u0020\u0020In infants, particularly in babies up to 3 months of age, after taking down the fever it is necessary to look for a doctor. In older children, if fever exceeds 40 째C, it is also recommended to look for a doctor during the first day of illness as it might be a sign of serious bacterial infections. Shaking (excessive shivering) during the raise of the temperature,rash and/or worsening of child\'s general condition require medical assistance without delay. Avoid overheating (overdressing, covering) of the child during transportation.</string>
    <string name="temperature_doses_ibuprofen"><b>5-10 mg/kg of body mass/doses.</b>\nDosage: Dosages are based on the child\'s weight. Give the medicine every 6 hours. Do not give more than 4 doses in a 24-hour period.</string>

    <string name="vaccine_hepatitis_b">
        1. What is hepatitis B?\n\nHepatitis B is an inflammation of the liver which is caused by the hepatitis B virus, It usually manifests itself
        with vague symptoms (general feebleness, nausea, loss of appetite), and some infected persons may develop jaundice.\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 In children, the disease can go without symptoms, but often the insufficiently strong defense system of child\'s
        organism cannot completely destroy the virus. In that case, the child will become a chronic carrier of the virus and have
        a chronic illness, which can later develop into serious complications, such as cirrhosis or primary carcinoma of the liver.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The younger the child, the greater the chance that after being infected with the virus of hepatitis B, he or she will develop
        serious complications in the form of a chronic liver disease.\n\nA child can be infected with the virus of hepatitis B:\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 at birth from a mother who is a chronic carrier of the virus;\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 in close contact with an infected person (using a common toothbrush or manicure set, through small wounds, bites
        and scratches);\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌through infected blood, for example, accidentally through and infected injection needle which has benn contaminated,
        or through infected blood products;\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 sex is the most frequent cause of infection in adolescents and adults.\n\nVaccination against hepatitis B can prevent the occurrence of the disease.\n\n2. How is a child vaccinated against hepatitis B?\n\nThe vaccination scheme against hepatitis B contains three doses of vaccine which the child must receive in order to be
        protected fully and for a long time against infection.\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The first and second dose are administered 1 month apart, and the third dose is administered 5 months after the second dose,
        or according to another scheme if the doctor so decides. Consult your doctor on the necessity for further revaccination.\n\nSince
        1999, according to the Mandatory Immunization Schedule, in the Republic of Croatia children in the 6th form of primary school
        are vaccinated against hepatitis B, while children born in after 2007 are vaccinated while still in the maternity hospital.\n\nIf a child must be protected earlier (for children born 2007), this is possible after consultation with the child\'s
        paediatrician.\n\nChildren of mothers who are chronic carriers of the virus are immunized immediately after birth. All pregnant women
        are routinely tested for hepatitis B!\n\n3. Some children must not be vaccinated or have to wait.\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌Children who after the previous vaccination against hepatitis B developed an allergic reaction to the vaccine and
        children who are allergic to any component of the vaccine must not be vaccinated.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children who are seriously ill and have a high fever must wait until they recover.\n\n
        4. What are the possible adverse reactions to the vaccine?\n\nThe vaccine against hepatitis B is very safe.\n\nMild reactions (which are, in fact, the most commonly recorded) include:\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 soreness, redness and hardening of the skin at the site of the injection\n\n
        Moderate reactions (rare):\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 tiredness, fever, temporary high temperature\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 rash, itching\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain.\n\nThese present not obstacle for further vaccination.\n\nAlthough extremely rare, an allergic reaction may occur several minutes to several hours after the administration of
        vaccine. The symptoms include difficulty breathing, hoarseness, a rash, paleness, general feebleness, increased heart
        rate, and vertigo.\n\nIf you notice any of the above symptoms contact the doctor immediately!</string>

    <string name="vaccine_dtap">
        1. What are diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough (pertussis)?\n\nDiphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough (pertussis) are dangerous diseases caused by bacteria. Diphtheria and whooping cough
        are transmitted from person to person. Tetanus can enter the body through a cut or wound.\n\nDIPHTHERIA causes the formation of a thick membrane in the back tissue of the pharynx, which causes difficultly breathing,
        paralysis, and can stop the heart and lead to death.\n\nTETANUS causes painful muscular contractions throughout the body. It can also cause a blockage of the jaw so that the patient
        cannot open the mouth or swallow. Tetanus is fatal in one in ten persons. The bacteria enter the body through a cut or wound.\n\nWHOOPING COUGH (pertussis) causes coughing fits that are so violent that they prevent children from eating, drinking or breathing.
        These severe coughing fits may last for weeks. Complications can lead to pneumonia, convulsions, brain damage and death.\n\n2. What types of vaccine are there against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis?\n\nThere are two types of vaccines. These vaccines differ only in the composition of one part of the vaccine (antigen) against pertussis:\n\n
        a) whole cell pertussis vaccine\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 very affective\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 was used for a large number of years\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 caused somewhat more frequent adverse reactions\n\n
        b) acellular pertussis vaccine\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 In the acellular vaccine, only some important parts of the cell that cause a good immune response are separated, which also
        provides efficient protection.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 More rarely leads to severe unwanted reactions.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 It was developed in an attempt to reduce the adverse reactions of vaccine.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The majority of developed countries use exclusively this type of vaccine against pertussis (USA, Canada, UK, Germany, Austria, Italy,
        Sweden, Belgium, Slovenia, etc.). The acellular type of vaccine is also used in the Republic of Croatia.\n\nWhen are children vaccinated with the DTaP vaccine?\n\nIn order to be protected, children must receive 5 doses of the DTaP vaccine; one at each of the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6
        months, 2 years, 4 years.\n\nThis vaccine can be administered simultaneously with other vaccines that are given at those ages.\n\n3. Some children must not be vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis or have to wait.\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 A child who has experienced an allergic reaction to the first dose of DTaP vaccine must not receive a second dose.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 It is also very important to inform the doctor if the child has ever had febrile convulsion (seizures that come with high fever).\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Inform the doctor if your child after receiving a DTaP shot:\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- had any kind of adverse reaction\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- had serious reactions (seizure, collapse, reddening of the skin covering more than half of the leg or arm)\n

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- had a fever higher than 40.5 째C\n\nOlder children and adults\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The DTaP vaccine must not be given to adults and children over 7 years of age due to the component against pertussis. However,
        older children, adolescents and adults have to be revaccinated with DT against diphtheria and tetanus at the ages of 7, 14 and 19,
        and every ten years after that.\n\n4. What are the possible adverse reactions caused by the DTaP vaccine?\n\nContracting diphtheria, tetanus or whooping cough carries much higher risks that the DTaP vaccine!\n\nAs with every medication, vaccines also carry the risk of adverse reactions. The risk of this vaccine causing severe and very severe
        reactions is extremely small.\n\nMild reactions (which are, in fact, those most frequently recorded):\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 soreness, redness swelling at the site of the infection\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 unusual crying\n

        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 high fever\n\nThese occur 48 hours after vaccination. The are not an obstacle to revaccination.\n\nSevere reactions (unusual):
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 convulsions (seizures caused by fever)\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 inconsolable crying that last continuously for over 3 hours\n

        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 swelling covering more than half of the leg or arm\n\nThese reaction also occur 48 hours from vaccination, but may also appear after 7 days. Contact your doctor immediately! These
        are not obstacles to continue vaccination, but your paediatrician will decide when and how.\n\nVery severe reactions (very rare):\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 allergic reactions\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Consciousness disorder (coma, inhibited consciousness) is an extremely rare reaction. This kind of reaction would present and
        obstacle for continuing the administration of DTaP. If a very severe reaction to the vaccine appears, contact the doctor immediately.\n\nThe majority of adverse reactions usually occur within 1 to 7 days from vaccination and most frequently disappear without any consequences.\n\nWhat if a severe of very severe reactions occurs?\n\nAlthough extremely rare, an allergic reaction may appear several minutes to several hours after administering the vaccine. The
        symptoms include difficulty breathing, hoarseness, a rash, paleness, general feebleness, rapid heart rate, and vertigo. In all these

        &lt;b>Protecting children against infectious diseases through vaccination&lt;/b>&lt;br>&lt;br>
        All of us come into daily contact with many pathogens that can cause serious diseases, damage to the organism and, in the worst
        cases, death. Vaccination is the greatest success of 20th century medicine. It has saved more lives than any other medical intervention in history.&lt;br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;The prevention (immunoprophylaxys) of infectious diseases is carried out in two ways - actively and passively.
        Active immunoprophylaxys is a procedure that we call vaccination, where the organism is stimulated to develop its own specific
        defenses against a particular infectious disease. Passive immunoprophylaxis is a procedure where the organism is temporarily protected
        against a particular disease. Passive immunoprophylaxis is a procedure where the organism is temporarily protected against a particular
        infection by the provision of ready-made protective antibodies. This paper deals with active immunoprophylaxis - vaccination. Since
        infectious diseases are frequent and particularly dangerous in infancy and childhood, the vaccination of children is of the greatest
        significance.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;b>Vaccine types&lt;/b>&lt;br>&lt;br>
        Vaccines may be divided into live and inactivated/killed vaccines. Live vaccines contain attenuated disease-causing viruses which have
        been subjected to various processes in order to lessen their capacity of causing diseases, while at the same time keeping their capacity
        to multiply in the tissues or cells of the person who has been vaccinated. These types of vaccines include vaccines against tuberculosis,
        rubella, measles, mumps and polio. Inactivated vaccines contain dead microorganisms (pertussis vaccine), parts of microorganisms (
        vaccines against influenza, diphtheria and tetanus toxins, soluble capsular material of pneumococcus, meningococcus and Haemophilus
        influenzae type b bacteria) or parts of the virus DNA separated through genetic engineering (hepatitis B vaccine). The most important vaccine
        ingredients are called antigens because the organism of the person being vaccinated creates specific protective anti-bodies against them.
        The antigens are dissolved in a solvent, most frequently sterilised water, a physiological solution or a composite solvent.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;b>Mandatory Immunization Schedule&lt;/b>&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;a href="http://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Pages/Schedule.aspx">EU Immunization Schedules&lt;/a>&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html">USA Immunization Schedule&lt;/a>&lt;br>&lt;br>
        Most of mandatory immunization schedules in EU and USA, contain vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP),
        haemophilus influenzae type B, polio, measles, mumps (parotitis) and rubella (MoPaRu), and hepatitis B. Vaccines against chickenpox,
        streptococcus pneumonia, meningococcal disease and rotavirus infections, also play an important role in preventing infectious diseases
        in children. These are vaccines that are in some preventing infectious diseases in children. These are vaccines that are in some countries
        recommended rather than prescribed for children.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;b>How often doses vaccination cause reactions?&lt;/b>&lt;br>&lt;br>
        Most vaccinated children manifest no reaction to the vaccine, or sometimes a very mild reaction, such as a mild fever and soreness at
        the site of the injection. More serious reactions, such as for example, convulsions, occur very rarely. Very serious reactions to vaccines
        occur so rarely that it is difficult to assess the risk of their occurrence.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;b>What are the symptoms of moderate and severe reactions that a parent should be aware of?&lt;/b>&lt;br>&lt;br>
        After your child has been vaccinated, pay attention to the appearance of any unusual symptoms, such as high fever (> 40 째C), changes in
        behaviour and signs of an allergic reaction (difficulty breathing, hoarseness, a rash, paleness, general feebleness, rapid heart rate,
        vertigo and weariness). If such reactions occur, call your paediatrician. If he or she is not at work, call the doctor on duty and ask
        for advice!&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;b>Vaccination with combination vaccines&lt;/b>&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;b>1. What are combination vaccines?&lt;/b>&lt;br>\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 All combination vaccines contain several antigens and provide simultaneous protection against several contagious diseases.&lt;br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Combination vaccines that have been in use for a long time and are used routinely include DTaP against diphtheria, tetanus
        and pertussis (whooping cough), and MoPaRu against measles, mumps (parotitis) and rubella (German measles). These vaccines were also
        administered in the past as separate vaccines, so their combination today represent no novelty.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;b>2. Why have combination vaccines been developed?&lt;/b>&lt;br>\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;Combination vaccines are the future in vaccinating children, because vaccines are being discovered for an increasing number of diseases.&lt;br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 If separate vaccines are used, each child would have to receive 15-19 doses of various vaccines within the first 18
        months of his or her life.&lt;br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The administration of combination vaccines offers you and your child significant advantages in comparison with separate vaccines:&lt;br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- fewer injections for the child - fewer tears and less pain;&lt;br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- fewer visits to the doctor;&lt;br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- lower costs than with separate vaccines;&lt;br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- less risk from potential doctors\' mistakes.&lt;br>
        Combination vaccines are widely used in developed countries. Some countries include combination vaccines in their National Immunization Schedule
        (UK, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Slovenia), while some countries have introduced recommendations regarding infectious diseases against
        which children should be vaccinated, and leave the decision on the type of vaccine (single or combination) to the doctor and the parent.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;b>3. What are the common characteristics of combination vaccines?&lt;/b>&lt;br>\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 All the components in a single dose of vaccine provide equal protection both in combination and when administered separately.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Combination vaccines do not cause more adverse reactions than separate vaccines. These vaccines have been thoroughly tested,
        both in clinical studies and by being massively used (for example, in Germany).&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;b>4. Which combination vaccines are used in Croatia?&lt;/b>&lt;br>\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 In addition to MoPaRu, which has been administered for a long time now, a five-component combination vaccine
        containing Haemophilus influenzae type b, DTaP (containing the acellular vaccine against pertussis), and the inactivated vaccine against
        polio is also used in Croatia. There is also a six-component vaccine, consisting of the vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b, DTaP (
        which contains the acellular vaccine against pertussis), the inactivated vaccine against polio, and hepatitis B.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;b>5. What are the risks of combination vaccines?&lt;/b>&lt;br>\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The risks are the same as in using the component parts of these vaccines (DTaP, polio, Hib, hepatitis B) separately,
        and they are described in the sections dealing with these separate vaccines.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;b>6. What if a severe adverse reaction occur?&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Although extremely rare, an allergic reaction may occur several minutes to several hours after the administration of the
        vaccine. The symptoms include difficulty breathing, hoarseness, a rash, paleness, general feebleness, rapid heart rate, and vertigo.&lt;br>

        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 A child can contract Hib in contact with other children or adults who carry the bacteria, without being aware of it. The germs are transmitted
        from an adult ir from one child to another by droplets through the air or through secretions from the respiratory system.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 If the bacteria remain in the child\'s nose or throat, the child will probably not get ill. However, if Hib bacteria spread to other places
        in the respiratory system or enter the bloodstream, they can cause a very serious disease. Purulent meningitis is the most common disease
        cause by Hib. It is most common in children under 5 years of age, and the most vulnerable are those from 6 to 11 months old. The disease is fatal
        in 2-5\%% of patients, and can also leave lasting consequences in the form of mental retardation, deafness and/or speech disorders in 15-30\%%
        of children who survive the disease.\n\nHib can also cause:\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 pneumonia\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 epiglottitis - an inflammation of the flap in the throat, which can lead to difficulty breathing and suffocation\n

        paleness, cold extremities, and vomiting\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 purulent join inflammation\n\nBefore the Hib vaccine was introduced within the Mandatory Immunization Schedules of developed countries, this type of bacteria was the leading
        cause of bacterial meningitis in children younger than 5.\n\n2. How is a child vaccinated against Hib?\n\nVaccination against Hib prevents the onset of diseases caused by this type of bacteria.\n\nWho must be vaccinated and when?\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 According to the Vaccination Schedule, children are vaccinated against Hib before they are 5.\n\n3. Some children must not be vaccinated against Hib or have to wait.\n\n

What type of polio vaccines are there?\n\nThere are two types of vaccines against polio:\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 \"killed\" - inactivated vaccine against polio - IPV - which is administered by injection;\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 \"live\" - oral vaccine against polio - OPV\n
        - which is administered through the mouth in the form of drops.\n\nBoth vaccines provide immunity against polio and may be administered simultaneously with other vaccines. The Mandatory Immunization Schedule
        in Croatia uses only the inactivated vaccine (IPV).\n\nWhen are children vaccinated against polio?\n\nIn order to be protected, children must receive 6 doses of the vaccine; one at each of the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 2 years, 7 years, and 14 years.\nOther vaccines can be simultaneously administered at this age (DTaP, Hib, hepatitis B).\n\n3.

        1. What are measles, mumps and rubella?\n\n
        MEASLES is a viral disease characterised by a rash, coughing, runny nose, irritation of the eyes and high fever. Approximately
        17\%% of those who contract the disease develop one or several complications, such as ear infection, pneumonia, febrile convulsions
        (seizures caused by high fever), diarrhoea or a brain inflammation (encephalitis).\n\nThe most common complication, pneumonia, occurs in
        around 6\%% of patients and is the leading cause of death from measles, which, in developed countries, amounts to 1 out of 1000
        patients, while in developing countries it amounts to as much as 1\%%.\n\n
        MUMPS also known as parotitis, is also a viral disease. The parotitis virus causes high fever, headache, and swelling of glands. It
        may also lead to deafness, meningitis, a painful swelling of the testes and ovaries, and, albeit rarely, to death.\n\nRUBELLA (popularly known as German measles) is caused by a virus, and manifests itself in a rash, a moderate fever and an
        inflammation of the joints (mostly in women). If a woman contracts rubella when she is pregnant, she can have a miscarriage or give
        birth to a baby with serious physical disabilities.\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 A child may very easily contract the disease from an infected person in his or her surrounding, because the viruses are airborne.\n\n2. How is a child vaccinated against measles, parotitis and rubella?\n\nThe vaccine against the carriers of these three diseases is combined into a single injection which is called MoPaRu.\n\nChildren must receive two doses of this vaccine:\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 the first around the time they turn one;\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 the second at the age of 6 or 7 (in the 1st grade of primary school), and they can receive it simultaneously with other vaccines.\n\n3. Who must not be vaccinated or must wait?\n\n

        reaction to eggs.\n
        Children with unstable neurological diseases.\n\n4. What are the possible adverse reactions to vaccination?\n\nVaccines, just like all medication, may cause adverse reactions, but vaccination against measles, parotitis and rubella is much safer
        that contracting these diseases. Most children who are vaccinated against these diseases do no experience any problems at all.\n\nMild reactions:\n

        1. What is tuberculosis (TBC)?\n\nMany developed countries have abolished vaccination against tuberculosis. Since tuberculosis still occurs in Croatia, the vaccination
        continues. Tuberculosis affects all organs, most frequently the lungs. It is spread by droplets through the lungs. It is spread by droplets
        through the air, through coughing. The disease is most critical when it occurs in very young children.\n\n2. Normal reaction at the spot where the TBC vaccine was administered.\n\nA blister appears on the forearm immediately after vaccination, which disappears after a few hours. In the 2-3 weeks that follow,
        nothing in particular happens at the spot of the vaccination, but then a small purple node begins to appear. The central part of this node
        can secrete a little moisture. After that time, the node heals leaving a small scar, which will remain for life as a reminder of the vaccination.\n\n3. Some children must not be vaccinated against tuberculosis, or they have to wait.\n\n

        Vaccination against S. pneumoniae can prevent the occurrence of serous forms of disease caused by these bacteria. Due to the growing resistance of these bacteria to
        antibiotics, treatment is becoming increasingly hard, which justifies the prevention of these diseases through vaccination.\n\n
        2. How is a child vaccinated against S. pneumoniae? (for children over 2 years of age)\n\n
        The polysaccharide vaccine against pneumococcus protects against 23 types of S. pneumoniae. A healthy person will develop an immune
        response to most of these types of bacteria within 2-3 weeks after vaccination.\n\n
        Who can be vaccinated and when?\n\n
        The vaccine can be administered to all healthy children, but it is particularly recommended for children at high risk (children
        whose spleen has been removed, or those suffering from diabetes, chronic liver disease, or diseases leading to liquor leakage,
        children with a hearing aid, children with congenital immunodeficiency, HIV infection, nephritic syndrome, malignant diseases of blood
        producing organs, children undergoing therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressives, children after an organ or bone marrow
        transplant).\n\nWhen are they vaccinated?\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The vaccine can be administered to children over 2 years old age. A single dose of vaccine is recommended for healthy children.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children with a compromised immune system are administered the vaccine in two doses. If they are under 10 years of age, the second dose
        will be administered 5 years after the first one.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Healthy adults are vaccinated with a single dose of the vaccine. The vaccine may be administered simultaneously with other vaccines
        in children.\n\n3. Some children must not be vaccinated or have to wait.\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children who experienced an allergic reaction to the previous dose of vaccine against pneumococcus must not receive a second dose of
        this vaccine.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The vaccination of moderately or seriously ill children must be postponed until they fully recover.\n\n
        4. What are the possible adverse reactions to the vaccine?\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 On average, about half of the vaccinated persons experience mild reactions, such as redness and soreness at the site of injection.
        These reactions are temporary and do not leave any consequences.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Less than 1\%% of vaccinated persons may experience high fever, muscle pain, or more severe local reactions. This vaccine, just like any
        other medication, may also cause an allergic reaction.\n\n
        What if a severe adverse reaction occurs?\n\nAlthough extremely rare, an allergic reaction can occur several minutes to several hours after the administration of the vaccine. The
        symptoms include difficulty breathing, hoarseness, a rash, paleness, general feebleness, rapid heart rate, and vertigo. If you notice
        any of the above symptoms, contact the doctor immediately!\n\n
        5. How is a child vaccinated against S. pneumoniae? (children between 2 months and 2 years)\n\n
        The purpose of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine against the pneumococcus disease is to provide active immunization against invasive diseases
        (sepsis, meningitis, a bacterial form of pneumonia and bacteraemia) caused by serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7 F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19 A, 19F and
        23F Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants and young children between the age of 2 months and 2 years, and in high-risk patients between
        the age of 2 and 5.\n\n
        The administration of this vaccine may significantly reduce the frequency of invasive pneumococcus disease caused
        by these vaccine strains, and there are data that show that this vaccine also decreases the frequency of pneumonia and, to a smaller
        extent, otitis media. According to limited data, the strains of pneumococcus included in the vaccine cause around 90\%% of invasive pneumococcal
        infections in north-west Croatia.\n\n
        The vaccine is administered in the form of an intramuscular injection. It is recommended to administer the vaccine in the outer area
        of the thigh in infants, or in the shoulder muscle of the forearm in young children. Infants from 2 to 6 months are vaccinated in
        three doses of 0.5ml each. The first dose is usually administered at 2 months, and the remaining two doses at a minimum of 1 month between doses.\n\n
        Thus, vaccinated infants are revaccinated within their second year of life (15 to 18 months). Previously unvaccinated older infants and
        young children infants from 7 to 11 months are administered two doses of 0.5ml each, at a minimum of 1 month between doses, followed
        by the booster vaccination (revaccination) between the age of 15 and 18 months.\n\n
        Children between 12 and 23 months are administered two
        doses of 0.5ml each, at a minimum of 2 months between doses. Children between 24 months and 5 years are administered the vaccine in a
        single dose. \n\n
        6. What are the possible adverse reactions to the vaccine?\n\n
        The side effects of this type of pneumococcal vaccine may, just like other vaccines, be divided into local and systemic side effects.
        The local side effects are redness at the site of the injection in 12.1\%%, 14.0\%% and 15.2\%% of vaccinated persons within the primary vaccination
        cycle after the first, second and third dose respectively.\n\n
        Therefore, there is a growing tendency of local reactions occurring with
        each of the received doses. Significant redness has been defined as redness larger than 2.4 cm in diameter, which has been recorded
        in only 2\%% of vaccinated infants.\n\n
        Local hardening of the skin (induration) has been recorded in 10.7\%%, 12.4\%% and 12.1\%% of vaccinated
        persons within the primary vaccination cycle (1st, 2nd and 3rd dose), while local soreness was recorded in 25.2\%%, 22.9\%%, and 22.3\%% of
        vaccinated persons. It can be concluded that the incidence of these local side effects, as opposed to redness, does not grow with
        the number of administered doses.\n\n
        After revaccination, redness was recorded in 12.6\%%, hardening in 11.2\%%, and local soreness in 30.4\%%
        of vaccinated subjects. However, the frequency of significant local side effects after revaccination is low and amounts to 1.7\%%
        (redness larger than 2.4 cm), 3.2\%% (hardening), and 13.8\%% (local sensitivity).\n\n
        The percentage of vaccinated subject experiencing
        a fever higher than 39 째C amounted to only 1-3\%%. The percentage of systemic side effects after revaccination at the age of 12 to 15
        months is not significantly different from that after a series of primovaccination.\n\n
        The simultaneous administration of this vaccine with other paediatric vaccines is possible, and the observed interactions are not
        clinically significant.\n\n
        7. Who must not be vaccinated?\n\n
        Counter indications for the administration of this vaccine include over sensitivity to active and auxiliary matters and to the
        diphtheria toxoid. The administration of this vaccine must be postponed in persons with an acute infective disease.\n\n
        The vaccine must
        not be administered to children suffering from thrombocytopenia or other blood clotting disorders, which can be a counter indication
        for the administration of intramuscular injections. In children with a weak immune response, the creation of specific antibodies after
        immunisation with this vaccine may be reduced.\n\n
        The preventive administration of fever reducing medication is recommended for children with convulsive disorders or who have previously
        experienced febrile seizures (convulsions).

    <string name="vaccine_optional_chickenpox">
        1. What is chickenpox?\n\nChickenpox is a common child disease. It usually manifests itself in a mild form, but it can also occur in a mild form, but it can
        also occur in a more serious form, especially in very young children and adults.\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The varicella zoster virus is transmitted from person to person through the air or through contact with the liquid from the skin
        vesicles.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 In children, pneumonia and encephalitis caused by the varicella zoster virus are extremely rare. Death can only occur in
        children with a compromised immune system.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The scars that are left in the place of the vesicles disappear in a few weeks, and permanents scars occur only if the vesicles
        are additionally infected with bacteria (most commonly streptococcus or staphylococcus).\n\n2. How is a child vaccinated against chickenpox?\n\nVaccination against chickenpox prevents the occurrence of the disease. Most vaccinated children will not contract chickenpox.If such children are infected. the disease will be very mild and they will recover much faster.\n\nWho should be vaccinated and when?\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The vaccine is administered to children over 12 months of age, and it is recommended to be administered in two doses 6-10 weeks
        apart. Until recently, children received only one dose, but due to the increased aggressiveness of the virus, some of the vaccinated
        children contracted the disease anyway. For that reason, a recommendation was issued in 2012 for the introduction of a booster dose.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children older than 13 and adults must also receive 2 doses, 6-10 weeks apart. The vaccine against chickenpox may be administered
        simultaneously with other vaccines.\n\n3. Some children must not be vaccinated against chickenpox or have to wait.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children who previously in their lives experienced an allergic reaction to eggs, gelatine, neomycin antibiotic (for those who are
        supposed to receive two doses of vaccine) or to the previous dose of vaccine against chickenpox must not be vaccinated.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Pregnant women must not be vaccinated with this vaccine. A woman vaccinated against chickenpox must wait at least 3 months before
        getting pregnant.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children with a compromised immune system must not be vaccinated\n\n4. What are the possible adverse reactions to the vaccine against chickenpox?\n\nAs with any other medication, vaccines can also cause adverse reactions. The risk that this particular vaccine will cause severe reactions
        is extremely small. Most persons vaccinated against chickenpox experience no side effects.\n\nMild reactions (which are, in fact, most commonly recorded) include:\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 soreness, swelling and redness at the injection site\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 high temperature\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 a mild rash\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 an extremely rare possibility of infecting another person (only in children with a weakened immune system)\n\nWhat if an allergic reaction occurs? \n\nAlthough extremely rare, an allergic reaction can occur several minutes to several hours after the administration of the vaccine.
        The symptoms include difficulty breathing, hoarseness, a rash paleness, general feebleness, rapid heart rate, and vertigo.  If you notice
        any of the above symptoms, contact the doctor immediately!

    <string name="vaccine_optional_flu">
    1. What is flu?\n\n
        Flu or influenza is an infectious disease caused by the influenza virus. In itself, flu is not a dangerous disease, although it can
        lead to serious complications which can even be fatal. The symptoms appear suddenly and cause high fever, chills, sore muscles and a
        strong headache. Often this is accompanied by secretion from the nose and a strong cough that may last for weeks.\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Flu is very contagious (1 passenger with flu symptoms in an airplane can infect up to 27% of other passengers). You can contract
        it by breathing the air near someone coughing or sneezing, if you are in close contact with a person who has got the flu, or if you
        touch an infected object and thus transfer the virus into your respiratory tract.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children are more contagious than adults and they spread the flu virus for longer. They are also more frequently hospitalised for
        flu than for other contagious diseases, most commonly when they are younger than two. \n\n
        Who can get the flu?\n\n
        Anyone can get the flu, including people wor are generally in good health. Also, if you have the flu, you can inadvertently pass it
        on others, because 1-4 days can go by before the first symptoms appear, and we are contagious for as many as 5 days after the
        symptoms occur.\n\n
        2. How is a child vaccinated against the flu?\n\n
        Vaccination prevents the onset of the flu. Vaccination is done before the flu season (October, November); for children under
        7 is it administered in two doses 4-6 weeks apart. Vaccination must be repeated every year since the flu virus mutate every year.\n\n
        Who should be vaccinated against the flu?\n\n
        Children with chronic diseases belong to the high-risk group of persons who can develop life-threatening complications from being
        infected with flu, and they should be vaccinated against the flu. In order to protect high-risk children, persons who come into
        contact with them should also be vaccinated!\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 All children between 6 and 23 months and the members of their families should be vaccinated;\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 patients of institutions for the care of patients with chronic diseases;\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 children with chronic lung diseases (asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dyslasia);\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 children with congenital heart diseases, kidney diseases, hemoglobinopathy, diabetic children, children with a compromised immune
        system (including HIV infection);\n

        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 all those who wish to avoid the flu.\n\nWhen should one be vaccinated against the flu?\n\n
        Both children and adults must be vaccinated every year before the beginning of the flu season (from September to November), although it
        is not to late even during the season (from November to April; most commonly from the end of December to March). Protection is
        acquired one to two weeks after vaccination.\n\nWhy do we have to vaccinate every year?\n\nFlu viruses constantly mutate. As a rule, new strains of the flu virus appear each season. The most active viruses for each season.
        The most active viruses for each season are determined by the World Health Organization and they are included in the composition of the
        vaccine that is produced for the coming season.\n\n3. Some children must not be vaccinated against the flu.\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children under 6 months of age\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children who have had an allergic reaction to eggs or to the vaccine against the flu\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children who are moderately or seriously ill have to wait until they fully recover.\n\n
        4. What adverse reactions can be caused by the flu vaccine?\n\nAs with every medication, vaccines also carry the risk of adverse reactions. The risk that this vaccine will cause severe reactions
        is extremely small. Most persons vaccinated against the flu do not experience any adverse reactions.\n\n
        Mild reactions (which are, in fact, the most commonly recorder) include:\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 soreness, swelling and redness at the site of the injection\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 high fever\n\nSevere allergic reactions are very rare. Although extremely rare, an allergic reaction can occur several minutes to several hours after
        the administration of the vaccine. The symptoms include breathing difficulty, hoarseness, a rash, paleness, general feebleness, rapid
        heart rate, and vertigo.\n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, contact the doctor immediately! For all other information about vaccination against the flu,

    <string name="vaccine_optional_hepatitis_a">
        1. What is hepatitis A?\n\n
        Hepatitis A is an inflammatory disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus. The disease begins with general symptoms,
        such as fever, feebleness, vomiting, diarrhoea, and only every 4th infected person turns yellow!\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 In around 25\%% of infected persons, the skin and whites of the eyes turn yellow, the urine becomes darker, and the stool
        lighter in colour.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 After 1 to 2 weeks, the symptoms of the disease disappear, but full recovery takes longer; in some patients as long as 6-12 months. \n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The incubation period after being infected with the hepatitis A virus is between 15 to 60 days.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The hepatitis A virus is spread through dirty hands and contaminated food and water. The infection very frequently occurs within
        a community (kindergarten, school, family).\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Vaccination is recommended as a safe form of protection against contracting hepatitis A.\n\n
        2. Who is subject to vaccination?\n\n
        Children at very high risk, or if travelling to high-risk areas where hepatitis A is an endemic disease (very common).\n\n
        3. How is a child vaccinated against hepatitis A?\n\n
        To achieve complete protection, two doses of vaccine have to be administered at any age, starting from the age of one. The second dose
        should be administered 6 to 12 months after the first dose.\n\n
        4. Some children must not be vaccinated or have to wait.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children who developed an allergic reaction to the vaccine after the first vaccination against hepatitis A and children who are allergic
        to any component of the vaccine must not be vaccinated.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children who have a mild illness, such as, for example, a cold, may be vaccinated, but the vaccination against hepatitis A of children
        who are more seriously ill and have a high fever must be postponed until they fully recover.\n\n
        5. What are the possible adverse reactions to the vaccine?\n\n
        The vaccine against hepatitis A is very safe. If any adverse reactions occur, they are, in most cases, very mild:\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 soreness and redness at the site of the injection\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 temporary fever, headache, tiredness, chills, nausea, and loss of appetite.\n\n

    <string name="vaccine_optional_rota_virus">
        1. What do rota viruses cause?\n\n
        Rota viruses are the most common cause of a severe form of gastroenteritis in infants and young children. The disease manifests itself
        by vomiting, diarrhoea and high fever and lasts for 4-8 days. Serious cases are characterised by dehydration and an electrolytic imbalance,
        where hospitalisation of the diseased is necessary.\n\n
        Rota viruses are omnipresent and 95 %% of children are infected by the age of 3-5.
        It is estimated that as many as 3.6 million children under 5 years of age contract this disease in the European Union, around 50,000 of
        whom are hospitalised, and 231 children die as a consequence of the infection.\n\n
        The greatest number contract the disease at an age between
        6 and 24 months, but the infection is not rare in early infancy, when the danger from a serious form of the disease and consequent
        hospitalisation is the greatest. Rotaviral infections in most developed countries usually occur during the winter months, most
        commonly from October to April. \n\n
        2. Paths of transmission\n\nRota viruses are highly contagious and are mainly through fecal-oral paths, but it is considered that the infection can also be spread by
        droplets (air) and through contaminated surfaces. The virus is transmitted regardless of the sanitary conditions.\n\n
        The improvement of the socio-economic situation, water quality, sewage systems and hygiene in developed countries have not succeeded in significantly suppressing
        the spread of the infection. The infection usually appears among office personnel, but epidemics in hospital paediatric wards are also
        common, as well as in outpatient clinics and IC units, where the spread of the infection is particularly difficult to control.\n\n
        In such cases, the consequences for the hospitalised child can be fatal, and the extension of hospitalisation significantly increases the costs of
        treatment. The virus can survive several hours on unclean hands, while in food or hard surfaces, such as toys, it can even survive up to
        several days.\n\n
        3. Clinical picture\n\nIn children under 5, the clinical picture can vary from mild short-lasting diarrhoea to severe gastroenteritis leading to a drop in blood
        pressure, circulatory collapse and death. The symptoms usually last several days and diarrhoea disappears spontaneously.\n\n
        However, a severe
        form of the infection can rapidly progress and cause life-threatening dehydration which required urgent intravenous rehydration. After an
        incubation period of 12 hours to 4 days, diarrhoea and vomiting occur and last for 4-8 days. High fever and stomach pain are also common.
        The first infection is usually the most severe one, while the symptoms weaken at each subsequent infection.\n\n
        5. Vaccination recommendations\n\n
        The guidelines of two European umbrella associations, the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases (ESPID) and the European Society
        for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN), claim that due to the unacceptable degree of morbidity and mortality
        caused by RV infections in Europe, early vaccination, before the first rota virus infection, could prevent most occurrences of the severe
        form of the disease and its consequences for healthy children.\n\n
        For this reason, vaccination is recommended for each healthy child in Europe.
        Moreover, it is to be expected that vaccination against rota virus infection will also protect the adult population, which is especially
        important for older and immunocompromised persons.\n\nPursuant to these efforts, at the beginning of 2008 in Croatia, a National Committee for
        the promotion of the Prevention of Rotavirus infections in children was founded.\n\n
        6. About vaccines\n\n
        Two live attenuated vaccines against RV for oral administration are available in the markets in Europe and Croatia (Rotarix&#174;; GSK Biologicals
        and RotaTeq&#x2122;; SPMSD).\n\n
        Rotarix&#174; is administered in only two oral doses.\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The first dose can be administered from the age of 6 weeks. It is recommended to complete the vaccination by the 16th week, but it must be
        completed at the latest by the age of 24 weeks.\n\n
        It can be administered simultaneously with all monovalent or combination vaccines that are used in infancy during the same visit, including
        the hexavalent and pneumococcus vaccine. It is proven to efficiently protect against 5 of the most common strains of rotaviruses.\n\n
        In 96 %% of cases, it ensures protection against a severe form of rotaviral gastroenterocolitis in the first year after vaccination.\n\n
        In 100 %% of cases, it provides protection against hospitalisation due to severe rotaviral gastroenterocolitis within the first year after vaccination. It provides
        protection against in the first two years of a child\'s life, when the child is at greatest risk.\n\n
        The side effects most commonly reported during the conducted clinical tests were irritability and loss of appetite (1/10). An extensive test also showed that here is no increased risk of

        1. What is tick-borne meningoencephalitis?\n\nTick-borne meningoencephalitis is a viral inflammation of the brain and its membranes, which in children usually passes without leaving any
        permanent consequences.\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The carrier of the virus is an infected forest tick or common tick (Ixodes ricinus).\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 This is mainly a seasonal disease, which begins in March, becomes less common during the summer months and then again occurs more frequently
        in early autumn.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 The incubation period is from 1 to 2 weeks, after which a high fever occurs accompanied by feebleness and tiredness. This is followed by a
        permanent or temporary improvement, after which encephalitis or meningoencephalitis can occur accompanied by high fever, impaired consciousness,
        strong headaches and other disorders. Children usually fully recover from this disease and do not suffer significant complications or permanent
        consequences. \n\n2. Who should be vaccinated?\n\nPersons who visit areas where there are ticks infected with the virus causing spring-summer tick-borne meningoencephalitis (north-west Croatia,
        north of the River Sava).\n\n3. How is a child vaccinated against tick-borne meningoencephalitis?\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 A child can be protected against this disease by being vaccinated with an inactivated (killed) vaccine, which is administered in three doses.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 A period of 2 weeks to 3 months must go by between the first and second dose, and a period of 9 to 12 months between the second and third dose.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children above 1 year of age can be vaccinated. \n
        The vaccine may be administered to children simultaneously with other vaccines.\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 A booster dose is necessary after 3 years.\n\n4. Some children must not be vaccinated against tick-borne meningoencephalitis or have to wait.\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Children who are allergic to any component of the vaccine, or who had at some time experienced a serious allergic reaction to eggs must not be
        vaccinated. \n\n5. What are the possible adverse reactions caused by the vaccine against tick-borne meningoencephalitis?\n\nAs with any other medication, vaccines can also cause adverse reactions. The risk that this particular vaccine will cauase severe or very severe
        reactions is extremely small.\n\n
        Vaccination can lead to some adverse reactions\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 of local character in the form of redness and swelling at the site of the injection, and swelling of the surrounding lymph nodes\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 generic reactions such as tiredness, soreness in the arm or leg, nausea, headache, increased bodily temperature or a temporary rash.\n\nWhat if a severe adverse reaction occurs?\n\n
        &#160;&#160;&#160;쨌 Although extremely rare, an allergic reaction may occur several minutes to several hours after the administration of the vaccine. The symptoms
        include difficulty in breathing, hoarseness, a rash, paleness, general feebleness, rapid heart rate and vertigo.\n\nIf you notice any of the above symptoms, contact your doctor immediately!
